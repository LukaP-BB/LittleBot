# LittleBot
A bunch of code in python for some personnal projects of discord bots. Pardon my french.

bot_principal.py contains useful commands for discord server administration, such as linked channel and role creations/deletion, suppression of several message at once...
It also has general utilities such as message counting and ladder, and a lot of useless but funny (hopefully) features in reaction to messages.

puissance4.py implements a "connect 4" game that discord users interact with via sent messages. It is able to log winners/losers and the positions played.
It also has some leaderboards functions.
